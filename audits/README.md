# Audits

The circuits in the babyjubjub and oprf subfolders are extracted from [the noir directory in oprf-service](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/oprf-service/tree/831928bbce1e8b6356a56830d5aae3dde6e3cf4d/noir),
which was audited by LeastAuthority in Jan 2026. The accompanying audit report can be found in this directory [Least Authority - TACEO OPRF Noir Circuit Final Audit Report](./Least%20Authority%20-%20TACEO%20OPRF%20Noir%20Circuits%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf)
Not all of the audited circuits are part of this repository as they are not related to the generic OPRF functionality.
